## Objectives
- Create an engaging, visually appealing website that represents an aquaponics system  
- Practice front-end development skills through responsive web design  
- Integrate multimedia elements such as images and videos to enhance learning  
- Demonstrate clean code structure and organized styling conventions

## Lessons Learned
This project deepened my understanding of **front-end fundamentals** — especially how structure (HTML), design (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) come together to form a cohesive experience. I learned how to:
- Write maintainable and reusable CSS  
- Ensure responsive behavior across screen sizes  
- Optimize images and videos for faster load times  
- Think like both a developer and a designer
